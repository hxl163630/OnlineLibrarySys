# Online Library System

## Project Description
This is the final project of my CS 6359 Object-oriented Analysis and Design class

This current project aims to develop a web portal that allows users to be able to check out and return books and allows staff to maintain the library through the same system. 

This is the final iteration of this project, development was focused on making the program functional in a real-world environment. A patron will be able to search, check out, and return books. Staff, on the other hand, will be able to add, edit, search, and process returned books. They will also have access information about the members of the library.

Unit tests are implemented with Junit and Selenium for all FRs.


## Functional Requirement:
* FR1. The System shall allow members to check out books
* FR2. The System shall allow the members to return books
* FR3. The System shall provide search functionality
* FR4. The System shall allow staff to input new books/media
* FR5. The System shall allow staff to change details for existing media
* FR6. The System shall allow the staff to find info about specific library patrons
* FR7. The System shall provide a system for staff to process returns (This must allow the staff to note if any book needs to be                   repaired or disposed)

* NFR1. The System shall provide a login ‘page’ and determine type of user, and give the appropriate information after login (such as              currently checked out books)
